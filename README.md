### Master Thesis in the Masterâ€™s Degree in Internet of Things from IPbeja

# Noise Reduction in Radio Astronomy Images using ML 
## a comparison of methods for detection and treatment

#### This thesis has two objectives. 
#### The first is to present and make an overview of radio astronomy. This understanding is fundamental to pave the way for the second objective.
#### The second objective is to tackle the intricate and challenging task of noise reduction in astronomical data obtained by radio telescopes.

#### We do this by using two distinct Machine Learning (ML) models recurring to an HPC using tensorflow GPU. 
#### An Autoencoder model capable of reducing the noise by itself, and a CNN, that classifies the noise type and then needs a noise reduction algorithm to reduce it.
#### The results of both approaches are compared and what option makes the most sense to use is proposed.
